This was a project to explore some basics of clustering visualization and modeling. Thr project takes place under this guise:

A new disease has been discovered, Disease P, which has clinically been evidenced to contain variants similar to anemia.
As a pharmaceutical company, we need to create research teams per variant to devise treatments.
We want to use clustering techniques to identify the variants of Disease P.
